# Evaluato

This evaluator is the extension of the outcome of the research outcome called: [TORS: A Train Unit Shunting and Servicing Simulator](https://research-portal.uu.nl/en/publications/tors-a-train-unit-shunting-and-servicing-simulator-2)

The resulting Train Unit Shunting and Servicing problem motivates advanced research in planning and scheduling in general since it integrates several known individually hard problems while incorporating many real-life details. The developed an event-based simulator called TORS (Dutch acronym for Train Shunting and Servicing Simulator), that provides the user with a state and all feasible actions. After an action is picked, TORS calculates the result and the process repeats. This simulator facilitates research into a realistic application of multi-agent path finding and path evaluation.

This implementation consists of a backend written in C++, and a front-end written in python. **It is highly advised to use only the backend (C++)**.

## Project setup
The basic project setup uses the structure provided by cmake. The subfolders are subprojects:
* cTORS: The c++ implementation of the evaluator.
* cTORSTest: Unit test like version of the main functionalities

# Native support
* Linux [YES]
* macOS [NO] - via Dev-Container / Docker [YES]
* Windows [NO] - via Dev-Container / Docker [YES]


# First steps
### Create and activate a `conda` environment

Create env:
```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
```

Activate environment:
```bash
conda activate my_proto_env
```


If conda asks to init first (CondaError: Run 'conda init' before 'conda activate'):
```bash
conda init
source ~/.bashrc
conda activate my_proto_env
```

### Build with setuptools
You can build the evaluator and the python library with the following command.
```sh
mkdir build
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

### Build the evaluator from C++ source
In the source directory execute the following commands:
**Don't forget to specify** the `-DCONDA_ENV="path/to/conda_env"`
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCONDA_ENV="path/to/conda_env
cmake --build .
```
This has been tested with gcc 9.4.0 Older versions may not support the c++17 standard. 

### Build the evaluator with debug option
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCONDA_ENV="path/to/conda_env -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build .
```

To go back from debug to release:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCONDA_ENV="path/to/conda_env -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .
```

# How To Use ?

### Input files
The evaluator requires at least two input files:
- **`location`** - location of where the scenario happens (e.g., shunting yard)  
- **`scenario`** - scenario of train operations (e.g., train arrivals/departures at a specific time, required services)

To evaluate the validity of a schedule plan, a plan file is also needed:
- **`plan`** - schedule plan created to resolve a scheduling problem of the `scenario` in a `location`. 

The evaluator can be used in a `Main` environment or in a `Testing` environment

## Usage of evaluator in the Main Environment

In this environment evaluator has three main modes.
- **Plan Evaluation mode (EVAL)**: evaluates a schedule plan (provided as input) - it is an automatic process specifying the validity of a plan 
- **Interactive mode (INTER)**: the user is asked to choose an action to be executed in each state of the scenario
- **Plan Evaluation mode and storage of results (EVAL_AND_SOTE)**: the user can store all the evaluation results in a .txt file
Usage is:

```bash
cd build
./TORS --mode "EVAL"/"INTER"/"EVAL_AND_STORE" \
    --path_location "~/my_location_folder" \
    --path_scenario "~/my_scenarion.json" \
    --path_plan "~/my_plan.json" \
    --plan_type "TORS"/"HIP"
    --path_eval_result "~/my_evaluation_results.txt" (in EVAL_AND_STORE mode only)
```
Arguments:

**--mode** **"EVAL"** - Evaluates a plan according to a scenario and 

**--mode** **"INTER"** - Interactive, the user has to choose a valid action per for each situation (state) 

**--mode** **"EVAL_AND_SOTE"** -  same as EVAL mode but also stores the results, also precise: **--path_eval_result** **"~/my_evaluation_results.txt"** - to precise the .txt file to store the results

**--path_location** **"~/my_location_folder"** - specifies the path to the location file which must be called as `location.json`

**--path_scenario** **"~/my_scenarion"** - specifies the path to the scenario file e.g., `my_scenario.json`

**--path_plan** **"~/my_scenarion.json"** -specifies the path to the plan file e.g., `my_plan.json`

**--plan_type** **"TORS"** - plan follows a TORS plan format
**--plan_type** **"HIP"** - plan follows a HIP plan format (plan was issued by HIP)

### Example
In the project directory run:
```bash
./build/TORS --mode "EVAL" \
    --path_location "./data/Demo/TUSS-Instance-Generator/kleine_brinkhorst_v2" \
    --path_scenario "./data/Demo/TUSS-Instance-Generator/kleine_brinkhorst_v2/scenario.json" \
    --path_plan "./data/Demo/TUSS-Instance-Generator/kleine_brinkhorst_v2/plan.json" \
    --plan_type "HIP"
```
Or run the bash file [run_eval_example.sh](./run_eval_example.sh):

```bash
./run_eval_example.sh
```

*Example for plan evaluation wiht storage -* In the project directory run:
```bash
./build/TORS --mode "EVAL_AND_STORE" \
    --path_location "./data/Demo/TUSS-Instance-Generator/kleine_brinkhorst_v2/Fixed" \
    --path_scenario "./data/Demo/TUSS-Instance-Generator/kleine_brinkhorst_v2/Fixed/scenario.json" \
    --path_plan "./data/Demo/TUSS-Instance-Generator/kleine_brinkhorst_v2/Fixed/plan.json" \
    --path_eval_result "./data/Demo/TUSS-Instance-Generator/kleine_brinkhorst_v2/Fixed/evaluation_results.txt" \
    --plan_type "HIP"
```

Or run the bash file [run_eval_and_store_example.sh](./run_eval_and_store_example.sh):

```bash
./run_eval_and_store_example.sh
```



### Fixed - Valid scenarios

In [Fixed folder](./data/Demo/TUSS-Instance-Generator/kleine_brinkhorst_v2/Fixed/) there are many working scenarios, which were solved by **robust-rail-solver**, generated by **robust-rail-generator** and validated by **robust-rail-evaluator** (this tool).


### More Information about the evaluator (TORS)
Click on [**Description**](doc/Description_TORS.md).


##  Usage of the Plan evaluator in Testing Environment
This mode of the program was mainly designed to evaluate the feasibility of different HIP plans (shunting yard schedules) -- `TEST_CASE("Plan Compatibility test")` --, and to test the validity of the location and scenario associated to the given plan -- `TEST_CASE("Scenario and Location Compatibility test")` --. Nevertheless, this environment can be used to evaluate `robust-rail-solver` or `robust-rail-evaluator` formated plans in a test environment providing an overview about the test cases' success rate.

Note: This evaluator takes as input a HIP plan (HIP plan format is used). Nevertheless, it can also evaluate `robust-rail-evaluator` formated plans as well.  

### Plan/Scenario/Location testing - HIP

In [CompatibilityTest.cpp](cTORSTest/CompatibilityTest.cpp), the program uses environment variables to get the path to the `location` and `scenario` and `plan` and `evaluation resutls` files. 

To specify the `location`, `scenario`, `plan` and `evaluation resutls` files, use:

```bash
export LOCATION_PATH="/path/to/location_folder" # where the location.json file can be found
export SCENARIO_PATH="/path/to/scenario_folder/scenario.json"
export PLAN_PATH="/path/to/plan_folder/plan.json"
export RESULT_PLAN="/path/to/result_folder/evaluation_resutls.txt"
```

To run the test, use:

```bash
cd build/cTORSTest
./CompatibilityTest
```

In case of modification of the code, compile with: 

```bash
cd build
cmake --build .
```



# Note:
The tool was developed on Linux and building the tool on macOS might cause compilation and execution errors*. Therefore, a Dockerized version is also available in this repository. Moreover, to facilitate the development the tool is available in **[Dev-Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial)** 

(*) With gcc@9 Homebrew protobufer native libraries must be modified which is not a good practice

(*) With llvm Homebrew installation basic C Test files cannot be compiled on Intel-based mac systems

(*) Compile process is sucessfull under native clang (14), however, SIGILL - illegal instruction signal errors can happen during the tool's execution.  
 


# Build process - Native Linux - as standalone tool
In principle the robust-rail tools are built in a single Docker do ease the development and usage. Nevertheless, it is possible to use/build `robust-rail-evaluator` as a standalone tool

## Install dependencies 
### Install gcc
The following section explains how to compile this source code

Before build on Linux - Native support

Other dependencies to install:

```bash
sudo apt update

sudo apt install gcc-9

sudo apt install g++-9

# Building process - Dev-Container

In principle the robust-rail tools are built in a single Docker do ease the development and usage. Nevertheless, it is possible to use/build `robust-rail-evaluator` as a standalone tool

## Dev-Container setup
The usage of **[Dev-Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial)** is highly recommended in macOS environment. Running **VS Code** inside a Docker container is useful, since it allows compiling and use evaluator without platform dependencies. In addition, **Dev-Container** allows to an easy to use dockerized development since the mounted code base can be modified real-time in a docker environment via **VS Code**.

* 1st - Install **Docker**

* 2nd - Install **VS Code** with the **Dev-Container** extension. 

* 3rd - Open the project in **VS Code**

* 4th - `Ctrl+Shif+P` → Dev Containers: Rebuild Container (it can take a few minutes) - this command will use the [Dockerfile](.devcontainer/Dockerfile) and [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) definitions unde [.devcontainer](.devcontainer).

* 5th - Build process of the tool is below: 
Note: all the dependencies are already contained by the Docker instance.

### Create and activate a `conda` environment

Create env:
```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
source ~/.bashrc
```

Activate environment:
```bash
conda activate my_proto_env
```

### Build with setuptools
You can build evaluator and the pyTORS library with the following command.
```sh
mkdir build
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

### Compile the evaluator from C++ source
In the source directory execute the following commands:
**Don't forget to specify** the `-DCONDA_ENV="path/to/conda_env"`
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCONDA_ENV="path/to/conda_env
cmake --build .
```

### Dependencies installation
To generate the documentation, install the following programs:
```sh
apt-get install -y doxygen graphviz fonts-freefont-ttf
apt-get install -y libclang-dev
python -m pip install git+git://github.com/pybind/pybind11_mkdoc.git@master
python -m pip install pybind11_stubgen
```

### Generate the documentation
With the dependencies installed, cmake automatically generates the documentation. It can also be generated manually by running
```sh
cd cTORS
doxygen Doxyfile
cd ..
python -m pybind11_mkdoc -o pyTORS/docstrings.h cTORS/include/*.h -I build/cTORS
```
This produces as output the `cTORS/doc` folder and the `pyTORS/docstrings.h` source file. This last file is used in `pyTORS/module.cpp` to generate the python docs.
